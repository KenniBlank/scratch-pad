# Scratch Pad

This is project created with sdl2 in C. Last C project of mine. Currently this is the rough test draft. I make changes here and then later add them as better versions in another repo if I love it.

Actual Better Repo: [Repo Link](https://github.com/KenniBlank/Scratch_Pad)

## Docs:

To use: Just open "Scratch Pad". It is an executable

Images are saved to images folder
